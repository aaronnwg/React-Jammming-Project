# React-Jammming-Project
This is a codecademy.com React project. The instructions are to build a React web application that uses the Spotify API to allow users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account. The website is deployed to 'http://dark-knee.surge.sh'. In order to use the website, I've added my spotify api client ID in the spotify.js file.
To use the website, search for songs, then add the songs to a playlist. When 'Save to Spotify' os clicked, the playlist is then uploaded to my public spotify account. You can then view and listen to the playlist by going to spotify.com and searching for my public profile 'kingaaronkessler'.
